# EE-219-Large-Scale-Data-Mining
Large-Scale Data Mining: Models and Algorithms (19 Winter)
1. Programing: Python

## Project 1: Classification Analysis on Textual Data

1. Construct tf-idf representations of textual data.
2. Apply two dimensionality reduction methods: PCA and NMF.
3. Implement classification methods: SVM, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
4. Evaluate and diagnose classification results by precision, recall and F-score.
5. Construct the complete pipeline of a textual data classification task.


## Project 2: Clustering

1. Find proper representations of the data, s.t. the clustering is efficient and gives out reasonable results.
2. Perform K-means clustering on the dataset, and evaluate the performance of the clustering.
3. Try different preprocessing methods which may increase the performance of the clustering.

## Project 3: Collaborative Filtering

1. Build recommendation system using collaborative filtering methods.
2. Implement and analyze the performance of two types of collaborative filtering methods: Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering and Model-based collaborative filtering

## Project 4: Regression Analysis
1. Explored basic regression models on the Network backup Dataset, Boston Housing Dataset and Car Insurance Dataset.
2. Tested for over-fitting with cross-validation, while with regularization we penalized overly complex models.

## Project 5: Application - Twitter data
1. Tried to formulate and solve an instance of problem of predicting tweet activity in the future.
2. Used data from some of the related hashtags to train a regression model and used the model to make predictions for other hashtags. To train the model, we prepared training sets out of the data, extracted features for them, and then fitted a regression model on it.
